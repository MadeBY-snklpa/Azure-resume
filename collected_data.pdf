1.set goals for your project - 
		why server  monitoring important for organizations 
		servers are critical components of a n organizations it infrastructure , any issue with 
		them can have significant impact on the organzations operations.
		when it comes to to large scale monitoring a each individual server im time consuming
		this system is developed to overcome this issue.



2.introduce your projcet  - 
		
		
		data gathering device is based on  wifi enable ESP32 microcontroller 
		it's cost efective and have much more computational power than need 
		demostration of custom made iot board
		types of sensors which gathering data (power / temp / fans )

3.system architecture-
		present system architecture
		Explain the communication flow between the server, ESP32 chip

4.system functionality -
		
		server temp / fan monitoring ( threshold )	
		is power supply working 
		instant email notifications 

5.results and benifits-
		show email notifications
		reduce server fault detection time
